#Little different for ofice365 email from University where Duo 2FA login required for email like abc@manchester.ac.uk.
#Here, I coudn't use mutt-wizard automated process to succeed. 
#Therefore, I did it manually every steps and I coudn't find on internet about the total steps to be followed exactly for this kind of accounts.

#Learn from these links :

#Step by Step Guide-
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Request IT-services to enable IMAP for your University account
2. Follow the first link to edit the mutt_oauth2.py file accordingly and once you execute the command given below, you may not need to follow the rest.
Here, I used same email address abc@manchester.ac.uk for editing that file (i.e. for creating gpg key) and for the command below  where you need to 
provide your University email address.

~/bin/mutt_oauth2.py   ~/.mutt_token--verbose –authorize

3. yay –S cyrus-sasl-xoauth2-git
4. Manually Add the content of .mbsync file (attached with this repo) to the end of your existing .mbsync file
5. Manually Create abc@manchester.ac.uk.muttrc file at this location .config/mutt/accounts/
6. Add to abc@manchester.ac.uk.muttrc all those commands, similar to Gmail file : abc@gmail.com.muttrc or Outlook file: abc@outlook.com.muttrc 
which were created by automated processes using mutt-wizard (see file gmail/outlook, attached with this repo)
7. Manually add a MaildirStore folder for abc@manchester.ac.uk, similar to abc@gmail.com which was automatically created using mutt-wizard. Otherwise you will 
see MaildirStore error : cannot open store
8. mbsync -V  abc@manchester.ac.uk
